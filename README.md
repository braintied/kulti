# Kulti - Live Streaming Platform for Vibe Coders

**Built with Claude Code | Powered by 100ms | Launching December 2025**

---

## What is Kulti?

**Kulti** is a live streaming platform built specifically for vibe coders and creative builders. Unlike traditional streaming platforms, Kulti enables multi-person collaborative sessions where participants can pass screen control back and forth - think Google Meet meets Twitch, but built for the AI coding generation.

### The Problem We're Solving

- Vibe coders work in silos, missing real-time community feedback
- Twitch is for gaming, YouTube Live is for polished content
- No platform exists for raw, collaborative building sessions
- Educational content is outdated by the time it's published
- Current streaming tools require complex technical setup

### The Solution

**"Build Together, Live. No polish. No performance. Just raw building."**

A streaming platform where you can:
- Drop into working sessions with other builders
- Pass screen control back and forth seamlessly
- Get instant feedback while you build
- Learn by watching real-time workflows
- Build community around your projects
